          <h1>Developer</h1>
          <p>I have a background in Java, Swift, HTML, CSS, Javascript
            as well as data formatting "languages" like JSON and XML.</p>
          <p>My first internship was at News America Marketing, a paper coupon
            marketing agency that has an app called SmartSource Coupons on both
            iPhone and Android. I worked with the existing iOS developer to port
            the old, Objective-C project to a brand new Swift project, improving
            startup times and allowing a fresh start at graphics and UI design.</p>
          <p>I enjoy videos and resources that have to do with technology and
            design, such as UX and UI design tutorials and graphic design principles.
            I like to watch GoTo conference talks, as well as information sessions from
            Harvard's CS50 intro to programming channel. </p>
          <h1>Philosopher</h1>
          <p>I am pursuing a philosophy minor at Marist College. Philosophy is an
            overarching discipline with many applications in all walks of life,
            both personal and professional. I pride myself in the ability to reason
            and wonder, to admit when I do not know, and to seek the answer in a
            logical manner. I am interested especially in how artificial intelligence
            will affect the way humans conduct themselves in society, as well
            as how far it will progress before society deems it an issue or
            menace. </p>
          <h1>Wordsmith</h1>
          <p>I enjoy writing, both in the sense that I get to express my thoughts a
            cohesive matter, and to practice understanding how I think and express
            myself. Writing is a guide to others, but it is also a guide for the self,
            allowing one to understand what one is thinking, deconstruct it, analyze it,
            and attempt to express it efficaciously in the world through words and writing.</p>
          <p>The internet is a fantastic place to express one's self, especially because it allows
            many voices to dissent or affirm an opinion/claim. Such a forum breeds creativity,
            innovation, and collaboration.</p>
